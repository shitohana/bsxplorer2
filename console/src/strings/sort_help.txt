BSXplorer2 Sort Command

The sort command is used to reorder the genomic data within a BSX file. This is particularly useful to ensure a consistent chromosome order across multiple files before merging or comparison, or to adhere to specific reference genome conventions.

The command reads an existing BSX file, determines the desired order of chromosomes (either alphabetically by default or based on a user-provided list), and writes a new BSX file with the genomic batches ordered according to this list.

By default, if no specific order is provided, the command will read all chromosome names present in the input BSX file and sort them alphabetically. If a custom order is specified, only the chromosomes listed will be included in the output file in that exact sequence.

TYPICAL USAGE:
  # Sort a BSX file using the default alphabetical chromosome order
  bsxplorer2 sort input.bsx -o sorted_output.bsx --to-compression lzma

OUTPUT FILE:
  A new BSX file containing the same data as the input, but with genomic batches reordered
  according to the specified or default chromosome sequence. The output compression
  level can be specified.
