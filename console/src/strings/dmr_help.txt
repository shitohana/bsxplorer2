DMR (Differentially Methylated Regions) Analysis

This command identifies differentially methylated regions between two groups of bisulfite sequencing samples. The analysis follows a multi-step approach:

1. DATA LOADING AND FILTERING
   - Loads BSX files for both sample groups
   - Filters cytosines based on context (CG/CHG/CHH)
   - Removes cytosines with insufficient coverage or too many missing values
   - Only retains cytosines present in sufficient samples

2. SEGMENTATION
   - Groups nearby cytosines into segments based on maximum distance threshold
   - Uses Total Variation denoising (Condat's algorithm) to smooth methylation signals
   - Applies recursive segmentation with Mann-Whitney U-tests to identify homogeneous regions
   - Merges adjacent segments with similar methylation patterns

3. STATISTICAL TESTING
   - Performs 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on each segment
   - Applies multiple testing correction (Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, or Benjamini-Yekutieli)
   - Filters regions based on p-value thresholds and methylation differences

4. OUTPUT
   - Generates two files: all segments and filtered DMRs
   - Reports regions meeting significance and effect size criteria

TYPICAL USAGE:
  bsxplorer2 dmr -A sample1_group1.bsx sample2_group1.bsx -B sample1_group2.bsx sample2_group2.bsx -o results

ADVANCED USAGE:
  # Custom filtering and segmentation parameters
  bsxplorer2 dmr -A group1/*.bsx -B group2/*.bsx -o dmr_results \
    --context CG --min-coverage 10 --diff-threshold 0.1 \
    --max-dist 200 --initial-l 3.0 --padj 0.01

OUTPUT FILES:
  {prefix}.segments.tsv - All identified segments with statistics
  {prefix}.filtered.tsv - DMRs passing all filtering criteria

The filtered output includes genomic coordinates, sample group methylation levels,
statistical significance, and effect sizes for each identified DMR.
